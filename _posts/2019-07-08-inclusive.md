Yesterday independent senator Lynn Ruane wrote an article on the journal.ie about The 
community participation Bill 2019. Which includes improvements of the accessibility and 
inclusivity in playgrounds,more places to change children properly (as appose to on the floor) and 
many other great things that will benefit the disabled community.
Senator Ruane also makes a comparison between the number of registered accessible changing 
places in Ireland and the number of registered changing places in the UK which has a shockingly 
higher number. 



“Everyone should and can be an active citizen and participate fully in their lives,society and 
community.


We now have the opportunity, through this legislation, to move from the mere 
promotion of participation to the reality of it. 
We at awareness overload sincerely hope that this bill is passed and that our government stops 
promoting the idea of better accessibility more inclusion and starts making it a reality. 
Below is a link to the article.
