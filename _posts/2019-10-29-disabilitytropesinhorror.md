“Other than pornography, there is no film genre so concerned with the body, nor of gouging
a reaction from it, than horror.” – Emma Madden, 2019

of-eugenics-inspired-horror-ari-aster)
As of the time of writing, it is October 2019. With Halloween just around the corner, many
people around the world will be holding horror movie marathons to get in the mood,
indulging in classics like Friday The 13 th , Nightmare on Elm Street and Halloween among
others. While I personally am not a fan of horror movies, this time of year has inspired me
to take a close look at the genre, and I have found that it is rooted in ableist tropes and
themes ranging from the use of disabled bodies to make audiences repulsed to downright
eugenics. I intend to discuss all of this and more here.


Perhaps the most commonly demonized group when it comes to this is people with mental
illnesses. Many movies in the horror genre attempt to make monsters of mentally ill people,
and this dates back to at least 1920 with the German silent film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.
The antagonist of this movie is a hypnotist who uses a somnambulist to commit a series of
murders. This hypnotist, the titular Dr. Caligari, is described as “a raving madman”, is seen
writhing in a straitjacket and is clearly depicted as mentally ill. The tropes seen here may
seem archaic and insensitive, but they are still present in modern cinema, such as in 2019’s
Midsommar, the movie that inspired the quote at the beginning of the article. This can be
seen in the character Terri, who has Bipolar Disorder and is depicted as an emotionally
volatile burden with homicidal tendencies. These portrayals harm how real people with
mental illnesses are seen, and as writer Mary Beth McAndrews puts it in her Polygon article
‘Midsommar takes a step forward and a step back in its portrayal of mental illness’, “it is
difficult […] to feel that my diagnosis may strike fear of such acts into the minds of those I
choose to tell.” (https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/16/20694958/midsommar-mental-illness-
stereotypes-bi-polar-disorder-anxiety).


The poor representation of mental illness in horror extends even beyond people, to the
portrayal of places that offer care to them. If I was to say the word “horror”, there is a good
chance you would picture an asylum in your head. Used as a setting or plot device since at
least 1946’s Bedlam, horror movies have twisted the way mental hospitals are seen by the
public with their images of dingy, dark hallways, torture and straitjacket-clad patients
writhing and screaming. Discussing mental illness representation in video-games, a form of
media I have not yet mentioned but will discuss further later in the article, YouTube channel
Extra Credits describe how these portrayals often discourage people who need help from
getting it, which leads to conditions going undiagnosed and potentially harming the
individual. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hht0MtPZ_Ng)
Another way that horror vilifies disability is in its portrayal of physical disfigurement and
deformity. From Jason Voorhees, the Friday the 13 th villain whose face is deformed as a
result of hydrocephalus to Victor Crowley, the disfigured antagonist of the Hatchet series,
physical disability and disfigurement is so commonly used in horror it has even spawned the

subgenre Body Horror. This genre relies heavily on the idea that there is nothing scarier to
an abled audience than an “abnormal” body and can be traced back to a controversial
movie from 1917, The Black Stork. In this movie, a doctor called in to operate on a
“defective” child refuses to operate on them, other doctors operate on the child and he
grows up deformed and vengeful, eventually killing the doctor who “condemned him [to]
life”. This movie was made around the start of the rise of eugenics in America and uses
deformity and disability as a shock tactic, suggesting disabled people should be left to die or
else become a hideous monstrosity.

Similarly to how poor portrayal of disfigurement led to the creation of the Body Horror
genre, the tropes I have discussed have slowly but surely made their way into a large
amount of genres, often showing very few signs of their horror roots. An example of a very
recent film that does this is the 2019 thriller Joker. In brief it shows Arthur Fleck, a mentally
ill comedian, and his transition into the Batman villain The Joker. This movie heavily relies on
equating mental illness with violence and shows that this trope is still used to this day.
So far, I have limited my discussion to movies, but it is important to note that they are not
the only form of media guilty of the above-mentioned tropes. Video games especially cover
all the points that I have made so far. Take Vaas Montenegro from UbiSoft’s Far Cry 3 for
example, a violent, unhinged pirate who is heavily implied to be mentally ill. This character,
with the exception of one or two moments, is extremely one-dimensional, injuring and
killing others for seemingly no reason other than his insanity. Similarly, the Rocksteady title
Batman: Arkham Asylum is a prime example of the demonization of mental institutions,
being set entirely inside a dark, unnerving asylum with its villains being the patients. Finally,
an example of Body Horror in videogames can be seen in the horror game Amnesia: The
Dark Descent, with the Gatherers. These enemies are tall, humanoid creatures with
unnaturally large mouths that hang open. While not linked to a specific real-world
condition, it’s clear that the appearance of this enemy is inspired by Body Horror tropes.
Overall, the horror genre is full of ableist tropes that work to demonize mentally ill,
physically disabled and disfigured people, and these tropes have also been adopted by films
and other media of different genres. However, there is hope for the future, as certain media
such as video games with the game Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice are starting to cast off the
shackles of ancient horror tropes and portray disability, disfigurement and mental illness in
a nuanced, respectful way.
