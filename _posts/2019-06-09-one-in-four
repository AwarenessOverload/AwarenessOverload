According to a study published in 2018 by the charity Scope, one in four disabled people in the UK actively avoid public transport (https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/uknews/one-in-four-disabled-people-avoid-using-public-transport-because-of-negative-attitudes/ar-BBOcnhb), and this number is similar in Ireland (https://www.breakingnews.ie/ireland/majority-of-those-with-disabilities-unhappy-with-access-to-public-transport-898292.html). This is mostly because of a reason that might not spring to mind first if you think about this. It wasn’t physical accessibility that made them think this way, nor was it being denied a space. No, the reason they gave was the attitude of other passengers towards them.

Taking a glance at many of the things disabled people have said about travelling on public transport, it’s not hard to see why this is the case. Many report verbal, and in some cases physical, abuse that they have received simply for daring to travel on the bus or train, such as 19 year-old student andwheelchair user Jessica Barton, who recalls a bus journey during which she received verbal abuse from six men and women all the way home from an event simply for asking a woman to move a pram out of the accessible seating area(https://www.lep.co.uk/news/latest/teenager-in-wheelchair-left-distraught-by-abuse-from-bus-passengers-as-others-just-watched-on-1-9465229). Personally, I have experienced similar verbal abuse to that reported by Jessica and have been called names such as ‘cr*pple’ by people when told to move from the wheelchair seating bay.

This is amplified for those with invisible, or hidden,disabilities. Often, people with disabilities of this kind are hounded with questions or receive verbal abuse simply because they “don’t look disabled”. I am a strong believer that if a person is disabled, they will benefit from use of disabled seating even if their disability is not visible. However, this can lead to abled  people (which is a more inclusive term since I am no longer only talking about physical disability) policing the space, telling them that they should not be using it and that it’s only for “real disabled people”. For many people with disabilities that can walk, balance is still a major issue, and in cases when all other seats are full, a seat is needed or else serious damage can be caused, but harassment can stop them from doing this, and it’s not hard to see why this would deter them from using public transport altogether.

Overall, a large amount of the disabled community avoid using public transport because of the verbal abuse they receive from other passengers, and this is a serious issue that has a big impact on disabled people and their lives.
