Transport for Ireland have a certain duty to facilitate for EVERYONE seeking use of public transport in Ireland. Right? Is it ridiculous to say that one wheelchair space on a bus is not enough?

“Almost 50% of people living with a physical disability experience difficulty with going outside the home alone” central statistics office who did a national disability survey in 2006. 
In 2016 another national survey revealed 643,131 or approximately 13.5% of Irelands population suffered from a physical disability. The government made a decision to cut essential transport subsidy schemes such as the mobility allowance and motorized transport Grant with a view to creating a new travel subsidy scheme in 2013 but now 6 years later that issue remains unaddressed. 

These statistics are extremely overwhelming when layed out as is above. A huge number of people in Ireland are lacking independence,social status,confidence,freedom, and instead are forced to live a life of constant dependence on a parent,guardian or carer they are vulnerable without that person and cannot live any sort of real, fullfiling,enjoyable life without them. This is at least partially due to the accessibility and inclusion that society has failed to provide them. I say this with deep sincerity. It simply isn’t good enough!

For example: the 75 bus route is from goes from the Square (Tallaght) to the Dart station in Dun Laoighre. To have only one wheelchair space on that bus and to feel confident that they are facilitating for the public adiquitly Transport for Ireland are implying that between Tallaght and Dun laoighre there will be only one wheelchair user who will need to use the 75 bus at a time. Setting aside common sense for a moment, The statistics above prove that they are very much mistaken.

I long to see the day where more people with disabilities will be able to freely go from A to B with minimum effort the same as everyone else.
