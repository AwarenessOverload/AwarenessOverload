I am 20 years old. Like many people my age, I am a college student. Unlike many my age,
however, I do not have a job.
Or rather, let me rephrase that: unlike many abled people my age, I don’t have a job.

It’s quite a different story when it comes to disabled people, especially so in Ireland.
According to a report made by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) in 2017,
less than a third of disabled people in Ireland were in employment
(https://www.socialjustice.ie/content/policy-issues/work-and-people-disabilities),
compared to 69.9% of abled men and 59.5% of abled women in the same year
(https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-
wamii/womenandmeninireland2016/employment) This is one of the lowest employment
rates in the EU, which itself has an average employment rate of 47% for people with
disabilities (http://www.edf-feph.org/employment). It is also lower than in America, where
40% of the disabled population are in employment
(https://www.bls.gov/news.release/disabl.nr0.htm). Also, according to research done by the
National Disability Authority found in the paper ‘Disability and Work: The Picture we Learn
From Official Statistics’
(https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=http://nda.ie/nda-
files/Disability-and-Work-The-picture-we-learn-from-official-statistics.pdf&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi-
s5f58sXjAhVMUMAKHaL5C-MQFjAJegQIAhAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw3DJLaFXVUBciEjg_RhIi7q), in
cases where people become disabled during their life, the employment rate goes down over
time, so from 0-6 months after becoming disabled a person has a 57% chance of
employment, but 10+ years after, it can be as low as 37.4%.
Another element of this issue is that often, biases mean that many visibly disabled people in
particular have to work harder to get a job. Interested in this, I took to Twitter to ask what
age visibly disabled people got their first job at. I managed to get 30 replies to this tweet,
and found that the average age in this sample was 20. Of course, this data is based on
replies mostly outside of Ireland, but regardless it should give you an idea of this problem on
a global scale as well. Considering the fact that the average age for an abled person to get a
job is 15 (https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/first-time-for-everything-when-
should-kids-get-a-job-a-phone-a-date-300321636.html) the difference between these ages
shows that there is significantly more of a struggle for a visibly disabled person to get into
the workforce. On the other hand, some people with invisible disabilities report being able
to get a job much earlier in life, however this often involves “acting abled” and hiding their
disability, which can be very stressful, particularly for those with mental disorders. However,
even then it really depends on the disability as can be seen with how Kellie Wilson, a Deaf
British woman, reportedly applied for 1000 jobs in 18 months and did not get a single one

(https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/28/deaf-woman-desperately-searching-for-job-after-1000-
rejections-8182208/).
Speaking of Kellie Wilson, her story also brings up a question that goes through the minds of
any disabled person applying for a job: should I disclose my disability in my application?
Personally, I change my mind on this regularly, since there are both advantages and
disadvantages to it. The advantages of disclosing your disability are that it ensures that your
interview, if you get called for one, takes place in an accessible venue and it can also give
you a glimpse of how the company culture incorporates disabled people, which is important
if you do get hired.
There is only one disadvantage of mentioning your disability in a job application, but it’s a
big one: it might end your chances of getting the job. Personally, I have had very few job
interviews but the times that I have been called for an interview I had not mentioned my
disability beforehand, which led the place the interview was held being upstairs, but I do not
regret it. The way I see it, had I mentioned my disability in my application I wouldn’t have
even gotten the interview. Going back to Kellie Wilson, she also mentions being rejected
only when she told employers that she was deaf, since they were not willing to
accommodate her.
Once you have a job, however, the discrimination does not stop there. Many disabled
people report being paid sub-minimum wage, often for the same job as their abled co-
workers. While many people are aware of the gender pay gap, very little light is shed on the
disability pay gap. As such, statistics on this are sparse and we could not find any for Ireland,
but in the UK the difference between what abled people and disabled people earn is 13.6%,
(https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/11/gender-pay-gap-disability-
disabled-people-job) and it is 37% in the US (https://www.air.org/news/press-
release/those-disabilities-earn-37-less-average-gap-even-wider-some-states). Because of
this, working disabled people are paid wages that are far from liveable, leading to high
poverty rates among people with disabilities (According to The Journal, of the 6,906
homeless people recorded to live in Ireland in 2006, 1,871 were disabled
(https://www.thejournal.ie/disability-homelessness-3539504-Aug2017)) discouraging more
disabled people from working, which contributes to this problem.
Overall, getting a job when you’re disabled can often feel like navigating a minefield while
blindfolded. Because of biases held by abled people against people with disabilities, it is
significantly harder for us to get a stable, full-time job and keep it. Considering all of this, it’s
not hard to see why so many disabled people are made homeless and why others have
given up on employment entirely.
