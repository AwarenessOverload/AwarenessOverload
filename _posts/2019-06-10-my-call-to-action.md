My name is Seán O’Kelly and I was born with Spina Bifida.  I am a full-time wheelchair user. 

I don’t dwell on the fact that I can’t walk but what I do have big problem, that even in 2019 I am faced with challenges and limitations in my life which could be avoided. 

As a result of the frustration caused by some of these challengesI am now a disability activist and the Founder of the awareness & change campaign …….. ‘A DAY IN MY WHEELS’.

 

The issues which I have found to be most difficult are PUBLIC TRANSPORT, EMPLOYMENT and in many situations,limitations to where I can SOCIALISE.

 

 

PUBLIC TRANSPORT

I am lucky enough to be able to drive which has been life changing, but I struggled for years with a transport system that I could not rely on. 

 

The majority of people living with a disability are dependent on our trains, buses and taxis. 

 

Most of my experience is with using the DART and many of my journeys were fraught with problems. 

 

I could never be certain that – 

 
1. somebody would be at the Station to get me on the DART, 
2. someone would be at the other end to get me off 
3. or that the lift to street level would be operating.   

 

I have had experiences where fellow passengers or the DART Driver had to get me off, or I ended up stuck on the DART itself, transported to the next station beyond my destination.  

 

I have been stranded on the platform of Clontarf DART stationwith the lift out of order and unable to get on another DART as the Station was unmanned – it required a call to Irish Rail to request that they send someone to help me exit the train.

 

I welcome the recent change to the requirement to give 24 hours’ notice to use the DART. That has now been reduced to 4 hours’ notice. However, this doesn’t leave any room for spontaneity or for being delayed. There is no such thing as a last minutearrangement to meet a friend! Or a change in plans.

 

The decision to have so many DART stations unmanned has led directly to these problems. It may also explain why so many lifts are left out of order for days or weeks as no personnel are present to check daily on the operation of the lifts.  While this isparticular to me or others with a permanent disability, consider if any one of you acquired a temporary disability – a broken leg perhaps – requiring a lift to exit a Dart Station!

 

 

EMPLOYMENT

In relation to employment, the 2016 census shows that in Dun Laoghaire Rathdown 25% of people with a disability are in employment compared to 54% of the general population who are employed. 

 

I have personally undertaken endless, unpaid, work placements and internships but find it impossible to secure paid employment. 

 

Why is it that a person of my abilities seems to be unemployable and with the Economy reported to be approaching “Full Employment”?

 

 

SOCALISING

Socialising or going out is also a much bigger deal for a person with a disability. 

 

I have a friend who planned a date with his girlfriend who is also a wheelchair user, but Dublin Bus can only take one wheelchair user at a time which they hadn’t realised ……..so they just went home. 

 

I have regularly been out with friends and have been unable to access the wheelchair accessible toilet – doors don’t function – loo used for storage …. 

 

 

 

The issues that I have outlined are all solvable – it just requires a shift in thinking

 

I was one of the lobbyists outside Dail Eireann last year seeking the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities – 

 

the U N C R P D.  

 

IRELAND was the last country to ratify that Convention so when it did happen, we were thrilled. At the time I understood that Minister McGrath delayed the ratification to ensure that it could be properly enacted in Ireland. 

 

However the Optional Protocol, which would allow us to report any discrimination under the UN CRPD, has not been signed. This means that if my rights under the UN CRPD were to be violated, I have no recourse. 

 

It is my greatest hope that this will be sorted in the near future so that the rights of Persons with a Disability are equal in terms of recourse.

 

 

In the words of Martin Luther King “I have a dream”. 

 
• I HAVE A DREAM - that one day people with disabilities will be able to access public transport without the feeling of uncertainty. 

 
• I HAVE A DREAM - that up to 2 wheelchair users will be able to access any one bus simultaneously. 

 
• I HAVE A DREAM - that people with disabilities will be able to gain employment on their own merit. 

 
• I have a dream - that all SME’s as well as larger Companies will be equal opportunities employers from a disability perspective and will meet their targets annually. 

 
• I HAVE A DREAM - that people with disabilities can lead a more spontaneous life, with the right supports in place. 

 

MY CALL TO ACTION     is in the form of a quote: 

‘Alone we can do so little, together we can do so much.’

Thank you
