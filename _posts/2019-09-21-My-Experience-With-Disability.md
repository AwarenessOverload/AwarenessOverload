Disability has never been a foreign subject to me. Growing up, my older brother had Downs’ Syndrome, so I was constantly accompanying him and my mum to community groups for families with a child with Downs’. A consistent, recurring event from my childhood was glaring back at the people in the supermarket who looked at my brother with a look suggesting confusion or fear, or maybe something nastier.
I would spend lunch times at school - when my brother and I attended the same primary school - explaining Luke’s condition, why he couldn’t eat the same food as everyone else, and why would have a new surgery scar every so often. A significant portion of my identity lay in being a young carer for my big brother.
<br/>
<br/>
When I was thirteen, I had a fairly routine surgery to remove two rare skin tumours. I was in hospital for one night, woke up from surgery swearing, and I split the stitches in my lower back. Unfortunately, a slightly oddly shaped scar and a reduction in my personal collection of tumours was not all I came away with. That surgery - and the shock of it to my body - kick started an autoimmune reaction, 
which turned into Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). AS is a chronic form of inflammatory arthritis, and whilst I can manage it with a mixture of medication and lifestyle choices, I’ll have this condition for the rest of my life.
<br/>
<br/>
For context, it’s worth backtracking to look at how I was diagnosed with AS, as, unfortunately, I did not develop the condition and hobble straight into a diagnosis. When it turned out that my post-operative pain had turned into chronic pain, my surgeon assumed I had nerve damage, and that diagnosis stuck for almost three years. As the pain spread from the area localised to my surgery (my lower back)
and to my hips, down to my knees, and up to my shoulders, I tried suggesting that the pain may not have much to do with the surgery. This suggestion wasn’t listened to until I was sixteen, when I saw a new specialist. This kickstarted three years of testing every part of my body possible. After years of getting nowhere, I’d given up hope. My mental health had hit an all time low, I was desperate to put 
a name to the pain that I lived with daily. I wasn’t getting anywhere, until one day, when I was slumped and teary-eyed in a rheumatologist’s office, he took a biro pen and circled “non-radiographic axial spondyloarthropathy” in a leaflet from Arthritis UK. This was the longest name I’d seen, and I can’t say seeing this title brought much clarity to my condition. 
<br/>
<br/>
I was diagnosed with a non-radiographic axial spondyloarthropathy, an umbrella term for a group of inflammatory arthroses - of which Ankylosing Spondylitis is one - which affect your axial skeleton (around your trunk), that does not show up on an x-ray. Suddenly, years of confusion, of not knowing, of fear, had a name. We now use this term and ankylosing spondylitis
as my diagnosis. Upon diagnosis, I wasn’t immediately cured, I wasn’t given a new lease of life, but I was a little bit less lost with the newfound ability to put a name to my disease. 
<br/>
<br/>
I had the chance to look back at my diagnostic process after it ate up my life, and my mental health, for five years. My general reaction to that experience was, well, not filled with the most positive, or PG13, language. I could not get doctors to listen to me, as a teenage girl, I was ignored, my description of my crippling lower back pain was assumed to be exaggerated 
growing pains. I went through exams without medication, University applications with little support, and mental illness because simply, I couldn’t cope. People should not have to go through this. So, in March 2018, I, with one of my best friends from University co-founded [BVisible](https://https://www.bvisible.info), a not-for-profit organisation for people with invisible illnesses. We signpost to support 
services, run workshops, and create online content for, about, and by, people with invisible illnesses.
<br/>
<br/>
I’m 20 now. I have arthritis, I have polycystic ovary syndrome, I have OCD. I’m two years into a Politics and Sociology degree, I have a non-profit, and I have hope again. The main thing that brought me back from my deep dark patch, was not just getting a diagnosis, and therefore a treatment plan, but was finding a community of people with a range of disabilities, all of whom are there for eachother, and are helpful in
every sense of the word.
<br/>
<br/>
My experience of disability has been complicated (is it ever straightforward?). It has been multifaceted and highlights the intersectionality of disability. There is not one type of disabled person and giving a voice and representing a range of disabled people - ensuring all of their voices are heard - will normalise, and simplify, living with any and every form of disability.
