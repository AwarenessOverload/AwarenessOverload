There’s a news story currently making the rounds online about disability, and I thought I’d talk about it. Ryan Neighbors is a 10-year-old girl who has Spina Bifida whose school teacher
organised a school trip to the Falls of Ohio, a place he and everyone involved knew was extremely inaccessible, and took it upon himself to carry her around so that she could participate. 
The full story can be read here: [https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/hero-teacher-carries-wheelchairbound-student-through- wildlife-reserve-so-she-could-attend-school-a4245896.html]( https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/hero-teacher-carries-wheelchairbound-student-through- wildlife-reserve-so-she-could-attend-school-a4245896.html)
<br/>
<br/>
If you read this and were annoyed that the inaccessible trip was decided on despite the fact
that there is a wheelchair user in the class, you’re like me.
<br/>
<br/>
And you’re also, sadly, in the minority.
<br/>
<br/>
This story is one of many stories involving disabled people shared online solely to make people feel good. Another example is the story of Cillian Jackson, a boy whose family could not afford a power wheelchair, so a robotics team in a local school had to make one for him [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/03/us/robotics-wheelchair.html]. His family, who were not
poor, couldn’t afford a basic power chair, Ryan Neighbors’ teacher arranged an inaccessible trip despite knowing he had a wheelchair user in his class, these stories aren’t feel-good, happy stories, they’re examples of abled people stepping in to make up for a way that society has failed disabled people. This type of story, and others like it, have a name, inspiration porn.
<br/>
<br/>
“Inspiration porn”, a term coined by the late disability activist and comedian Stella Young, describes anything that, as Young put it in her TEDxSydney talk in 2014 [https://youtu.be/8K9Gg164Bsw](https://youtu.be/8K9Gg164Bsw) , “objectifies one group of people for the benefit of another group of people”, with the former group in this case being disabled people and the latter 
being abled people. It can come in many forms, such as images of disabled people with captions such as “The only disability in life is a bad attitude” or “what’s your excuse” and, indeed, news reporting, and a defining characteristic of this type of content is that it presents a disabled person not as an actual person, but a thing to inspire abled people, a concept, and it is 
often made and released without the consent of those involved.
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the most nefarious aspect of inspiration porn isn’t how it’s presented but rather the real-world effects of it, mainly its impact on the mental health of disabled people and the impact on how abled people interact with disabled people. A good example of both can be found in a Twitter thread (https://twitter.com/Imani_Barbarin/status/1071595793566654465) by someone in the 
disability community that I really look up to, blogger and public speaker Imani Barbarin. In this thread, Imani describes how the expectation put on her to be “inspiring” led to impossibly high expectations of herself which in turn led to depression. All of this is because of the pressure put on her by society through the second effect mentioned at the start of this paragraph, her
interactions with others. 
<br/>
<br/>
If you’re disabled, it can often feel like complete strangers, as Imani puts it, “pin their hopes and dreams on whether you smiled that day”. People congratulate you for the smallest things. Going outside, doing mundane tasks, simply existing. This praise, this contact, is often given without consent, and you don’t have to look much further than my own article on the #JustAskDontGrab
campaign to see why that can be very dangerous, particularly to Blind people. Reading this thread, I don’t doubt that Imani is telling the truth at all. Why, you ask? Because it has happened to me. People have done everything from congratulating me for going outside to trying to help me when I showed no signs of needing it, and it’s easy to see how this can wear a person down. Unfortunately,
media can have a huge influence on behaviour, meaning in a world saturated with inspiration porn, “helping” disabled people without consideration for how they feel and if they want help is unsurprisingly common.
<br/>
<br/>
Another type of feel-good story that arises is, strangely, when a disabled person exhibits a talent. This slightly goes against what has been said so far, since it’s no longer praise for a mundane task, but the objectification in this case comes from the “if they can do it, what’s your excuse” mentality. Take America’s Got Talent 2019 winner Kodi Lee for example. His audition was shared non-stop
on social media for a good month or two earlier this year, but it was not because of his admittedly phenomenal voice. The reason so many people shared it was because he’s blind and autistic. Many reaction videos made about this video include some variation on the phrase “If he can do it with all that’s limiting him, what am I doing?”, and this shows that even though Kodi is getting the recognition 
he deserves, many people are seeing him not as an individual, but as a thing to motivate them. For more on Kodi and the underlying ableism of how he is discussed, check out Barbarin’s blog post ‘Are You Inspired By That Disabled Person or Shocked They Were Included?’ 
<br/>
<br/>
Overall, feel-good videos and inspiration porn are some of the most common social media posts out there, and the damage they do to the disabled community is hard to ignore. Navigating the online world as a disabled person, it’s important to keep in mind that harmful messages can be easily disguised with a feel-good tone, and if you know anyone that shares this type of content regularly I would recommend 
discussing it with them, using this article and the work of Imani Barbarin and other disability rights advocates as a springboard. I hope to see a day when inspiration porn no longer exists, and the only way to get there is through change.
