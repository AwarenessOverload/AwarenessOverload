At the best of times, getting around using public transport is invariably a
nightmare. Before I passed my driving test back in December 2017, I (like
many) was relying on public transport in order for me to get around doing
‘normal’ things. This (by in large) didn’t go without some sort of a hiccup.
My first experience of using public transport was the start of independence for
me. Around 10 years ago, mum was away at the time. My dad always gently
nudged me further beyond what I thought my limits back then were.
In doing this (this time round), he brought me down to Dalkey DART station
(my nearest station). I arranged with the Irish Rail personnel that I was getting
off at Dun Laoghaire DART station – I went on my own. I went the short
journey and met my dad at the station. There were no problems or challenges
then.
10 years on, the Irish Rail service has worsened. The personnel on the ground
are really nice and helpful (when there is someone at the station), but the Irish
Rail policies in relation to people with ‘limited mobility’. From 2012 to 2015, I
used to get the DART daily to Bray where I was volunteering. Over that period,
I noticed that the stations (in particular Bray which is considered a main
station) were manned less and less. Since then the situation with the
unmanned stations has got worse.
I became a disability activist in 2016. I did so as a result of shear frustration in
particular with Irish Rail.
Back in 2016, I was learning to drive with the Irish Wheelchair Association at
the time. The arrangement that was made was that I would meet my instructor
weekly at Clontarf DART station. According to Irish Rail, their policy states that
those with ‘limited mobility’ need to ring ahead for assistance 4 hours in
advance of getting the DART. This used to be 24 hours and still is outside of
Dublin.
On March 8 th 2016, I rang Dalkey DART station a couple of hours ahead (as I
always did) to let them know what time I was getting the DART and where I
was going.
I arrived at Clontarf DART station and there was nobody there to meet me –
the driver of the train had to get me off. I approached the lift at the station to

discover that it was out of service and I was not told prior to leaving Dalkey
station.
I rang Pearse DART station in frustration letting them know what had
happened. An Irish Rail employee came from Killester and put me back on the
DART. I was stranded on the platform for half an hour.
A group called Access for all has been set up. It’s objective is to lobby to get the
lifts working on a continuous basis – I am part of that group. We are calling on
Minister Shane Ross to set up some intervention to get the lifts more reliable.

all Ireland.
