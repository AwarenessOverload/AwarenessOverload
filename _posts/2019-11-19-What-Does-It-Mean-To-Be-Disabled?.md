For many years and still on many occasions, people ask me what it’s like to be disabled. My first reaction is to reply, “I’m not!” This surprises many people and sometimes leads to further conversation. A conversation that I will explain here and hope you follow my train of thought, as this is a tough topic for 
many in the disabled world, as there are very many different and equal views.
<br/>
<br/>
I rarely have moments when I am not able to take part in things. I cannot play football, I cannot go mountain trekking and the mere thought of going away for the night takes a lot of planning on my part. The same can be said for a lot of people too. No one can do everything and we each have our 
own strengths that make us who we can. After all, how many people here are physically able to play soccer, but erm… might not have the skills?
<br/>
<br/>
For me, a disability is not something that I have, but the restrictions placed upon me by society and the environment that I enter. Questions need to be asked why these restrictions and obstacles are placed upon certain sections of society. I have often talked about accessibility and how forward planning 
needs to be incorporated into future building work to ensure that it is opened to as a many people as possible.
<br/>
<br/>
Society needs to open up to the idea that people with disabilities are not disabled as a person, but by the environment around. It’s one of the main reasons I push myself outside my comfort zone to do the things most people don’t, wouldn’t, shouldn’t and won’t. We have so much to offer and we need to break down 
the barriers.
<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything you want to do, but was told you can’t? Today start to plan it and do it, don’t let anyone show you what you can’t do. As that person out on a date; go to that nightclub people said you shouldn’t; apply for an evening course; or even buy that item of clothing you wanted, but were afraid to because you 
felt it wasn’t appropriate given your circumstance. I am planning to get outside of my comfort zone in a whole new way in 2020, if I am brave enough.

If you want to know what the picture above refers to. I once joined Abandoman on stage at the Omagh Laughs Back Comedy Festival. Thanks to Liam O’Neill for his help carrying my ton weight.
