This is part ten of a series of articles in which I will be discussing as many bars and pubs in the
Dublin area as possible and rating them based on how accessible or inaccessible they are. These
are the pubs and bars that I have covered so far:
PART 1
- P.Mac’s
- The Bernard Shaw
PART 2
- The Lucky Duck
- Against The Grain.
PART 3
- The Mercantile
- Peadar Kearney’s Pub
PART 4
- Arlington Bar
- The Auld Dubliner
PART 5
- The Portobello
- Oliver St. John Gogarty’s
- NoLIta
PART 6
Bruxelles
Bar Rua
The George
PART 7
- Lemon &amp; Duke
- The International

- Pygmalion Bar
PART 8
- The Hairy Lemon
- Peter’s Pub
- Grogan’s
PART 9
- The River Bar
- The Stag’s Head
- Fitzgerald&#39;s
And, as usual, this is how I will be marking each place visited:
- Entrance
- Space
- Bar
- Seating
- Toilet facilities
- Access to other floors (if applicable)
For this article, we will be staying near Camden Street, starting with Camden Bites &amp;
Brews. This cocktail bar has a single-door entrance of about average width, with a
gradual rise up to it that may need a bit more effort to get up in a wheelchair, but it is
far from inaccessible. Once Inside, Camden Bites &amp; Brews is quite a wide space, with
seating that is mostly a mix of stools and chairs at relatively high tables, and a tiled floor
that is mostly smooth and easy to move a wheelchair on. The bar itself is quite low and
easily reached, however the stools around it are quite narrow and not ideal. There are
accessible toilet facilities, however the room is quite narrow and the toilet is a bit far
away from the sink. Finally, there are no other floors in this bar, so that will not be
marked.
Overall, this is the final score I gave Camden Bites &amp; Brews:
Entrance: 4 / 5
Bar: 3 / 5
Toilet: 4 / 5
Space: 4 / 5
Seating: 3 / 5

Floor: 4 / 5
Access To Other Floors: -
Overall: 22 / 30

Staying on Camden Street, the next bar I will be discussing is Jimmy Rabbitte&#39;s
Speakeasy. As the name suggests, this bar is made to look like a Prohibition-era
speakeasy, a fact that does not bode well for accessibility considering how ease of
access is often an afterthought when it comes to buildings emulating the past. Anyway,
starting with the entrance, it is a set of heavy double doors that are a struggle to open,
and are usually kept closed. They are relatively wide though, which is good. Once Inside,
it becomes clear that this bar is not accessible, as the space inside is limited to a very
narrow strip that runs alongside the bar, which is low with small stools. Luckily, the
seating is not the worst, stools at small tables, and the floor is made of smooth wood,
but it’s impossible to have a wheelchair in this bar without causing a blockage of some
sort. There are toilet facilities in this bar, however they are incredibly narrow and not at
all wheelchair-accessible. Finally, there are yet again no other floors.
Overall, this is how I ranked Jimmy Rabbitte’s:
Entrance: 3 / 5
Bar: 3 / 5
Toilet: 1 / 5
Space: 1 / 5
Seating: 2 / 5
Floor: 5 / 5
Access To Other Floors: -
Overall: 14 / 30
Finally, moving a short distance from Camden Street, we have The Fourth Corner on
Patrick Street. The entrance to this relatively newly-opened bar is quite narrow, and
there are usually barrels around this area that may slightly obstruct the entrance. Once

Inside, however, there is quite a lot of space in this bar, with a floor that is made of
slightly rough wood and tiles that are not too bad to push a wheelchair on, but could be
better. The seating in The Fourth Corner consists of chairs at low tables, and there are
chairs around the bar as well which is quite low itself. There are unfortunately no
accessible toilet facilities, and there is another floor in this bar, but the only access is by
the stairs.
Overall, the marks I gave The Fourth Corner are as follows:
Entrance: 2 / 5
Bar: 5 / 5
Toilet: 0 / 5
Space: 4 / 5
Seating: 5 / 5
Floor: 3 / 5
Access To Other Floors: 0 / 5
Overall: 19 / 35
