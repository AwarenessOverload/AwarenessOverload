My name is Ami, I’m 24 and I’m from Norfolk, England. I have quite a few disabilities but in this post,
I will be bringing awareness to Sensory Ataxia.
<br/>
<br/>
Let’s break it down, Ataxia is a neurological disorder which affects coordination, balance and
walking. It can cause a variety of symptoms but the 3 I have mentioned are what I, personally, have
issues with. Sensory Ataxia, for me, is easier to explain by sharing an example of how it affects me
than trying to explain what it actually means.
<br/>
<br/>
For example, when I shut my eyes, I can’t tell where my body is. When I try to wash my hair, and
close my eyes, I can’t tell where my hands are. Unless I can feel the ground beneath my feet, then I
have no clue as to where my feet are. When my eyes are open, I can control my movement and you
would think nothing is wrong.
<br/>
<br/>
The diagnosis process took about 10 months in total, which I feel very fortunate as a diagnosis of
Ataxia can take years.
<br/>
<br/>
Intensive physiotherapy and occupational therapy have substantially improved my independence
and enabled me to regain my mobility. Before treatment, I couldn’t walk without falling, I couldn’t
grip anything, especially cutlery. I still need help when going to the toilet, washing and dressing,
amongst other things.
<br/>
<br/>
To aid my mobility, I am able to use a walking frame, but only for a few metres, and a Ross Return,
which is a standing aid that safely transfers me from bed to chair, chair to commode, etc.
<br/>
<br/>
In general, Ataxia is often seen as ‘acting like a drunk&#39; or ‘walking like a drunk&#39; and I can assure you,
that is definitely not the case. We are not drunk; we have a neurological disorder that impairs our
balance which causes an unsteady gait.
<br/>
<br/>
All we ask is, the next time you see someone a bit unsteady on their feet, don’t assume they are
drunk. They could have a condition which affects their balance. Not every disability is seen.
