To whomever is reading this I am going to explain to you the issues that I face as a carer to my son Jack. He faces so many issues as a boy with severe/profound intellectual and physical disability.
<br/>  
<br/>
We face discrimination on a daily basis. Every day I have to fight for something or a service on his behalf. Jack is 14 years old and has a complex medical diagnosis. He has Down Syndrome and a rare 
auto-inflammatory disease. As a result he is tube-fed around the clock, wears nappies and is on 15 meds numerous times daily. He is non-verbal and relies on me for everything. Yet he is a happy smiley 
boy and lives in the moment. He doesn’t bear grudges to those who discriminate against him because he is unaware. I, however carry a lot of anger and resentment because of the way he is treated.
<br/>
<br/>
Just one example of the discrimination we face is when we get to a venue there is no access for wheelchairs. This can even start when trying to find a parking space. So first of all we need to park the car and have plenty of space to lower the ramp at the back to let Jack, who travels in his wheelchair out. Then we need ramp access instead of steps to get in. Some places tell us we can gain access if we go down the back lane! I have done this a couple of times and it’s not nice. It’s scary and can make me feel vulnerable. Jack remains oblivious but it’s my job as his mum to protect him so I’d rather not take these risks.

<br/>
Then of course when/ if we do gain access... great but wait.... Jack needs me to change his nappy/pad. Well there are only 11 places to do this in the entire of the Republic of Ireland. So the likelihood that we are in any of those places is pretty low. You can see a list of those toilets/ bathrooms on www.changingplaces.ie
They differ to a regular wheelchair toilet because they feature an adult sized changing bench and a hoist as well as sink, toilet with space both sides for Carers and a privacy screen.
<br/>
<br/>
Jack loves going to the cinema, we begged our local one (Vue at Liffey Valley) to install a changing place but they would not because they don’t have to. That’s how little they care for people like my son. The building regulations need to change.

There are so many more issues that face us like aisles in shops are often too narrow for wheelchairs. Playgrounds don’t often cater for children in wheelchairs. Some do and that’s great, there are wheelchair swings and wheelchair accessible roundabouts available. But they are rare.

Access to beaches is another issue and some beaches supply beach wheelchairs which can go into the water and I say Bravo to all those who have supplied one. Last year during the heat wave we used the one on Skerries beach many times and it changed our day! Jack got to experience the sea for the first time.

Another huge issue is when people with disabilities travel using public transport, well this is not something that affects us yet. But it could. But I know that the lifts almost never work in lots of train stations and you have to phone ahead a couple of days in advance to ensure the ramp is there for you to access the train and at the other end to disembark.
Wheelchair adapted taxis are hard to come by too and buses I believe are a nightmare! You have to book your place in advance and often when your bus turns up it isn’t actually accessible! For independent people with disabilities trying to hold down a job this is a nightmare!

I haven’t even touched on education, employment or access to therapies and medical care. All of these issues are HUGE and deserve a piece of their own. What I can say about medical care in my experience is that right now things are getting worse within our health system instead of better. Children are languishing on the bottom of years long waiting lists for therapy, medical appointments and surgery. #CareCantWait
<br/>
<br/>
For people with disabilities and carers trying to live their lives with the person they are caring for ALL these obstacles become a nightmare. It often means people remain at home and don’t have access to experience and enjoy the world they are living in.
#Access
<br/>
<br/>
My son is treated as a second class citizen. I hate to think of all the people that are losing out because we do not provide equitable services to everyone. It’s time for change. Let’s embrace difference and promote inclusion. Real Inclusion not token inclusion. Let’s ALL LIVE our BEST life!
