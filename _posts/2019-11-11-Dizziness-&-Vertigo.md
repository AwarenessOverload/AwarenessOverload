<br/>
My name is Jonathan and I now live in Florida U.S., but I grew up in the U.K. I have Dizziness and Vertigo due to
inner ear damage. For 29 years I have been battling with this disability.
Vertigo is a very unpleasant spinning sensation that people can feel even if they are not moving. Dizziness is a
feeling of movement or motion a person might experience often described as unsteadiness. There a many possible
causes, most of them are associated with inner ear problems.
<br/>
<br/>
The Beginning….
<br/
It all began in May 1990. I was 15 years old and in my penultimate year at school. A virus struck me down for 2
weeks. After the virus was gone, I was left with an awful feeling of dizziness and vertigo that I have had ever since.
My head constantly feels like it’s swimming, as if I’m bobbing up and down in the sea unable to stop. It is often
accompanied by the most frightening attacks of vertigo, spinning that lasts for several hours that I can’t control.
<br/>
<br/>
At first it was a hard battle getting my doctor to believe me. He put it down to anxiety and panic attacks. I insisted
that my vertigo was altogether more physical. My insistence paid off and my doctor gave in, but it all proved
pointless. I was sent from one specialist to another. Each one said the same thing, “it’s anxiety, stress, panic
attacks”, but the worst thing was, “it’s all in your mind”. If I had ever heard that phrase said to me again, I think I
would have screamed. I was going through hell with the vertigo. I was having extreme dizzy spells about once a
week by this point and I was terrified.
<br/>
<br/>
Over the years next 4 years, with the help of my parents, I must have visited 5 or 6 specialists. I struggled to be
believed by anyone. It was heartbreaking. Not just because I was living in a world of vertigo but because no-one,
except for my mum and dad, believed me or understood what I was going through. I just wanted someone to listen
to me, but anything I said fell on deaf ears. The specialists would twist my words to make it fit their narrative of
what they believed the cause of my vertigo was.
<br/>
<br/>
I felt I had nowhere to turn. I would end up seeing counselors, psychiatrists and psychologists to talk through my
anxiety, like that was the only cause. The biggest irony was that was that the more I was told it was stress and
anxiety, the more stress and anxiety was created. This was due to the frustration of not being believed.
<br/>
<br/>
I would pass the time in my bedroom, watching TV or playing video games. I just wanted to escape from reality.
In 1994 my old doctor thankfully retired, so I ended up with a new one. This new doctor was younger, more
understanding and showed more empathy than anyone had previously. But at this point I was emotionally
exhausted from pushing to see one specialist after another, so I just gave in and stopped trying.
<br/>
<br/>
A Confirmed Diagnosis
<br/>
It would be a further 5 years before the cause of my vertigo was given a firm diagnosis. It was the summer of 1999
and I was in my mid 20’s. I had been subscribing to a magazine from the Meniere’s Society. This is a charitable organization that helps raise awareness for people with balance problems of every kind, Meniere’s Disease being
one of them. They had an article in one issue about balance clinics that were dotted all over England. I showed my
doctor the article and he got me an appointment.
<br/>
<br/>
In September of that year, after having many medical tests, I was finally told by this specialist that I have a
damaged nerve in my inner ear. THIS was the cause of my vertigo. At last I knew what it was and why the vertigo
was there. I wasn’t cured, but at least I didn’t have to prove myself anymore. I was on cloud 9 for days, but it
wouldn’t last for long.
<br/>
<br/>
By this time my anxiety had grown severely out of control. I was so busy perseverating about the vertigo, I
neglected the anxiety. Anxiety is one of the biggest triggers of vertigo. I was so determined to try and find a “cure”
for the vertigo so badly, instead of accepting it and trying to live. Sadly, any treatments I had for it didn’t work. I
was trying to live my life the best way I could. I was still living with my parents and would be for a long time.
<br/>
<br/>
The vertigo was still there, but the anxiety consumed me. No one understood what I was going through. I lost my
friends because of it and I withdrew into a feeling of depression, self-pity and self- loathing. I was also carrying
around so much anger and self-hate with me too. The thought of suicide had occasionally entered my mind. I’m
not sure how long I felt like this and lived this way because each day was much like the next. Years passed me by….
<br/>
<br/>
Then in 2015 I was called in for the Work Capability Tests that had been rolled out nationwide within the U.K. After
the 2008 recession these tests where created by the U.K government to get as many people off disability benefit as
possible. I felt I was put through hell. During a recession the most vulnerable people always suffer because they
make for easy targets.
<br/>
<br/>
During the initial assessment I went so dizzy that I ended up having to lay on the floor. That didn’t seem to matter
because it was ignored. If I could manage to walk upstairs unaided then according to the DWP (Department for
Works and Pensions) I was perfectly fit for work. This test was designed for people to fail. The people behind this
test knew nothing about disabilities. The ignorance was staggering.
<br/>
<br/>
I had to go to an appeal, which is a very hard and long process. With the help of my doctor and armed with so
much information about my case, I had the last laugh because I won my appeal. Although I did go extremely dizzy
in front of the judge who oversaw my case. From receiving my first notification of the disability test to winning my
appeal took 26 months. It catapulted my anxiety into the stratosphere. It felt so cruel. I know it wasn’t personal,
but it felt like it was.
<br/>
<br/>
I have never forgiven the Conservative government for what they put me through, and I probably never will.

<br/>
A Changing Life
<br/>
It was shortly after this though that I met my wife, who would change my life forever.
<br/>
<br/>
It was Christmas 2015 and I had been playing an online game called Farmville 2: Country Escape for almost a year.
In the game you can join what are called Co-ops. These are farming communities that you can join when you play
the game.
<br/>
<br/>
Patti was another member of our Co-op. We made a strong connection while playing. You can text with other
people in the game and we started to do that a lot. I discovered that she lived in Florida while I was in the U.K.
There is a 5-hour time difference between the two places. We would start to text chat when she got home from
work even though it was after midnight for me.
<br/>
<br/>
Within a few months we were talking on the phone. We discovered that we both had our own problems with
anxiety.
<br/>
<br/>
Over time Patti taught me some things that would go on to help me. She taught me Transcendental meditation,
how to live in the moment, to let go of my fear and not to be defined by my vertigo disability. Each one of these
things would help me immensely.
<br/>
<br/>
The Benefits of Meditation
<br/>
The meditation was hard at first. But after continually doing it for a few weeks, I slowly started to notice a
difference. I became less anxious than usual. I felt calmer and more confident overall. The vertigo, although still
frightening, was easier to cope with. I began walking around with a spring in my step. The anxiety was still there,
but I was able to cope with it much better too. I meditated twice a day for 20 minutes. I found this time so
peaceful. All the noise and commentary in my head disappeared. I started to smile naturally, and my world of
doom and gloom was fading. The anger that I had felt for so long also started to vanish.
<br/>
<br/>
I also learned how to be mindful from Patti. Being mindful means paying attention to what is happening in front of
you. My vertigo and anxiety were still there but it was under more control than ever before. I became calmer,
more at peace with myself. Vertigo is very frightening, but I know the worst spells will pass. From feeling rock
bottom to the top of the world in such a short time.
<br/>
<br/>
As we continued to talk the inevitable happened. We decided to meet for the first time. At first, the prospect of
meeting terrified me. But I remembered everything that I had been taught.
<br/>
<br/>
The Meeting
<br/>
We first came face to face in November 2016. She flew over to England to meet me. After flying on an overnight
flight, she got a train from the Airport. As she got off the train, I raced down the stations platform to meet her.
Patti and I spent the next 11 days journeying around parts of northern England together. In my wildest dreams I
never thought I could do anything like this. My anxiety was kept in check. My vertigo held up well. We loved every
minute we spent together. During this time, we even meditated together too. We were devastated when she had
to return to Florida.
<br/>
<br/>
We continued to talk all the time. My anxiety and vertigo took a back seat. I was on cloud nine once again. Others
could see the positive changes in me. I became more confident and out-going.
<br/>
<br/>
We met again the following March and spent another 10 days together. Believe it or not I got my passport and was
ready to fly to Florida to stay with her for a while. Meditation was having a wonderful effect. I was meditating
twice a day for 20 minutes at a time. No thoughts running through my mind, no chatter or noise I was at peace
and feeling on top of the world.
<br/>
<br/>
I flew over and spent 6 weeks with her in Florida in 2017. It wasn’t easy, there was a lot of planning involved due to
the vertigo and Patti flew over to England to fly back with me. When we met up again it was like we’d never been
apart. But just like the before, our time together would come to an end.
<br/>
<br/>
Soon after, we planned to see each other again. This time it was going to be just after Christmas of 2017. We
would spend 3 months together this time.
<br/>
<br/>
Time seemed to pass so slowly for us until we met again.
<br/>
<br/>
When we did meet again, we had 3 wonderful months together in Florida as we ventured across the Sunshine
State. But towards the end of our fourth time together, we became increasingly sad. We really thought this was it,
this was the end of us. We really didn’t know when we would be together again. I plucked up the courage and
asked Patti to marry me and she said yes! We married at a local courthouse and I applied for immigration status,
which has been granted to me.
<br/>
<br/>
A Happy Life
<br/>
Patti continues to work as a teacher, and I stay at home and do all the homey stuff. I’m calmer now, more at peace
with myself. Vertigo is still frightening for me, but I know the worst spells will go. I have a life now. I’ve even
developed a love of nature, especially gardening and I take care of everything around the house too. I do have to
rest a lot, only doing what I can before the vertigo really kicks in.
<br/>
<br/>
My family are very happy for me that I finally have a life. My dad even loves to tell people about me, saying that
he’s proud of me and it’s the best thing I’ve ever done. I’m so happy that Patti came into my life. My wellbeing has
improved dramatically. After 29 years I finally have a life. I have a wife and a stepdaughter too. I am the happiest I
have ever been. The vertigo still lays me low, but I must manage it as best I can. I use a walking stick now because
my balance has deteriorated even more over the years and it makes me feel more stable when walking. A sign of
getting older, I guess.
<br/>
<br/>
I do find myself missing England sometimes, especially my family. But time moves on and nothing stays the same.
I look back at those previous 25 years before I met Patricia. I often feel like it was some monumental dream that
never really happened. The ignorance, lack of understanding and empathy that I faced. We may be in the year
2019 but there is still a big lack of understanding regarding disabilities, especially those disabilities that are invisible
or hidden.
<br/>
<br/>
If the U.K government can show that amount of ignorance and lack of empathy, how do we convince other people
to understand what it means to be disabled, whatever that disability may be. There is a lot more to being disabled
than someone who’s in a wheelchair. The vertigo is part of me now, but it doesn’t define me anymore, not like it
used to.
