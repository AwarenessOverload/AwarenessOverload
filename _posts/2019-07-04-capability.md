Awareness Overload has over 400 users in the past month and over 600 viewers from all over the world. I have not written a single article since I published the first one when Awareness Overlaod was first launched. Thanks to the team of activists who are regularly posting articles on the site regarding public transport in Dublin,Wheelchair accessibility and other social issues to do with disability rights in Ireland, Awareness Overload has been able to grow into so much more than just a platform in which people with disabilities can voice there thoughts. Since the website was launched the team have managed to create: A chat room in which people can discuss issues concerning disability awareness,a review section where we give ratings on venues around Dublin on there accessibility,we post polls so which we study the results of to help us write more accurate articles,and so many more features to come!




My goal with Awareness Overload is to give people with disabilities the opportunity to speak up and voice there thoughts on disability rights issues in which our community faces on a daily basis not just when we leave the house but when we get out of bed in the morning! That is why I am incouraging YOU the reader to become the writer! Are you a wheelchair user who has to run the gauntlet every morning and hope that the wheelchair spot on the bus isn’t taken by a buggy or another wheelchair user? Or someone with an invisible disability who gets cussed at for parking in the disabled because you don’t “look disabled”? Or are you someone who struggles to make friends and socialize because “normal people” treat you like an alien? Well than write about it. I speak from experience when I say that through the proper channels your message will get out there and honestly you will feel better afterwards.
