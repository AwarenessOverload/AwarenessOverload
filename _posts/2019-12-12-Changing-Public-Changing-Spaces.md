<br/>
Chances are it has never crossed your mind. It didn’t cross mine until my son Brody (7), who is doubly-
incontinent, outgrew baby changing facilities.
<br/>
<br/>
The options are dire. You are forced to change your child in the most horrendous places, like the toilet
floor or car boot. It’s that or else limit their life experiences by staying at home and/or leaving places
earlier than your family wants to in order to find somewhere you can change them that isn’t unsafe,
unhygienic and undignified.
<br/>
<br/>
This issue sadly affects hundreds of thousands of disabled people and their families and carers in the UK.
It takes it toll both mentally and physically on your entire family. It’s hugely upsetting having nowhere to
change our beautiful boy. Soon, even the car boot will no longer be an option for us as he becomes too
big and heavy to lift and we may require a ceiling track hoist in order to lift him safely.
<br/>
<br/>
I can’t imagine how Brody feels being treated the way he is. It breaks my heart. Of course, this also has
an impact on his four year old sister Sydney too. It affects where we can go and sometimes means that
we have to leave early when she is having fun. How do we explain to her that we have to leave because
venues have a toilet for everyone but not her brother? How does it impact on her mental well-being
seeing her brother changed in awful places?
<br/>
<br/>
The solution to our problem is a Changing Places toilet; a 12m2 room with a peninsular toilet, an adult-
sized, height-adjustable changing bench and ceiling track hoist. These facilities allow disabled people to
go to the toilet safely and with dignity.
<br/>
<br/>
In Scotland where I live, a wonderful charity called PAMIS (Promoting A More Inclusive Society) lead
the Changing Places toilet campaign. Thanks to the charity, campaigners around the country and of
course mindful businesses who understand the importance of social inclusion, there are now 208
Changing Places toilets in Scotland. And there are 1420 in the UK.
<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, following a consultation, the Building Standards Division of the Scottish Government
amended the Non-Domestic Technical Handbook and added a new clause to cover Changing Places
toilets. This change covers facilities in large retail, assembly and entertainment buildings, hospitals and
schools with community facilities. Any new developments that meet the criteria outlined must now
include a Changing Places toilet in Scotland. This is an important and vital step forward for Scotland and
improving accessibility. Hopefully the rest of the UK will follow our lead!
<br/>
<br/>
However, despite this fantastic news, the fact remains that there are not enough Changing Places toilets
in Scotland or the UK to enable inclusion. My son and others deserve better than this. Afterall, going to
the toilet is a basic human right.
