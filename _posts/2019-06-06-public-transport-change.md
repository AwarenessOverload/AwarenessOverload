I use the DART a decent amount. Sometimes to get in and out of college. Sometimes to go out
and meet friends. It is a good service. What is not good is the way it treats its passengers,
specifically its disabled passengers.

  
3 times in the last 2 months I have arrived at a dart station, only to find the lift is out of order.


The first time I was coming home from college. I go to college in Bray Institute of Further
Education. I live in Shankill. I expected a simple journey from Bray to Shankill but unfortunately
had no such luck. I boarded the train at Bray, went to Shankill and got off. The lift in Shankill was
out of service. I got back on the train (thankfully it had stalled at the station long enough I didn't
have to wait for the next one) and I went on to Killiney with the plan to get off there, use the lifts
there to get to the southbound platform, and get the next train back to Shankill and use the ramp
there to leave the station. The lift in Killiney was out of order too. I had to call my brother to come
and pick me up.


The second time I had been out with my friend in Blackrock for the evening. It was getting late so
we decided to head home. Once we got to Blackrock I realized it would not be that easy, as once
again the lift was out of order. As it was about 11/11:15 I didn't want to get the train going the
other direction because the darts stop running around this time and I didn't want to risk being
stranded further from home than I already was. Thankfully I was with one of my friends. I had to
get out of my wheelchair and lift myself up four individual flights of stairs which was not
embarrassing and undignified but I felt like I had no other option. My friend also had to carry my
wheelchair up 4 flights of stairs.


The third time, tonight, I had visited that same friend who lives in Seapoint. I left at roughly 10,
and when I arrived at Seapoint dart station the lift to reach the bridge had a shutter covering it.
Once again, I had to resort to getting out of my wheelchair, climbing up the stairs on my own,
having someone carry my chair up and get back into it. It was either that or walk the half kilometer
back in the direction I had just come from to get to Monkstown station (where there was no
guarantee the lifts would be working there either.)


If I had a more significant disability, or was simply not as strong as I am I would have been
stranded and either had to call someone to come and pick me up or pay for a taxi home. In my
view neither of those options are acceptable. The dart is PUBLIC transport. Just because I have a
disability does not mean that I am not a part of the public.


This does not even begin to cover the issues of those who cant board the train themselves and
need to call in advance to make sure there there is assistance to get on and off the train, each and
every time they use it.


There is one simple solution to this problem: Have wheelchair accessible ramps on at every station
for every platform so people with disabilities can get to the train, and make sure there are workers
in each station to provide assistance for getting on and off the train. Everyone who can take the
stairs can use a ramp, not everyone who can use a ramp can take the stairs.


This is just three of the most recent times that I have had problems with public transport
personally and there are countless others who have stories of their own.


This is just the tip of the iceberg with accessibility issues in Ireland, not mentioning any other
public transport companies but something HAS to be done.
