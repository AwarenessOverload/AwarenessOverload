For those of you who did not read my Dublin to Dalyan travel log article, I was recently in
Dalyan, Turkey. While there, I encountered a few things that gave me a culture shock of sorts.
Of course there were the obvious things like the regular call to prayer, but one thing surprised
me more than anything else, and that was how easy it was to plan a day if you’re disabled.
Going on a boat trip for example, I simply showed up, paid, someone helped me get my
wheelchair on-board and we were off. Something like that simply would not happen in Ireland.
Spontaneity is simply impossible when it comes to travelling with a disability, and that’s what I
intend to discuss here.
Firstly, if you are a wheelchair user, in order to travel on some forms of public transport you
must contact the station you’re going to in the case of trains or even sometimes the company
itself, well in advance. To illustrate this, I will use another anecdote from my holiday, this time
about the journey to Dalyan. I mentioned this in my travel log article, but to get to Belfast
airport I took a Bus Éireann bus. Since there is only space for one wheelchair on only 78% of
buses in the Bus Éireann regional fleet (https://www.buseireann.ie/inner.php?id=384) I had to
contact them 24 hours in advance as stated on their website, otherwise I would not be able to
travel. While this was okay in my case, as I had planned the trip and booked the flight to Turkey
a few days before, I know from experience that plans often change, and I have no doubt that
many wheelchair users have been left unable to travel because of this policy. To be safe I
contacted Bus Éireann 2 days in advance. It should have been easy to make sure I could travel
then, right?
I’m afraid it’s not that easy.
Even then I was unable to get confirmation that I would be able to travel, as the help desk, the
only ones I could contact, did not know if the wheelchair space on the bus was reserved or not.
If this is the experience I had, I cannot even begin to imagine how it would be for someone
ringing 24 hours before or even closer to their travel time. A similar policy also applies to the
DART and trains, with Irish Rail suggesting to inform them 4 hours in advance. This is admittedly
more lenient than 24 hours but still quite limiting and would not work in emergencies
(http://www.irishrail.ie/travel-information/access-dart-northern-commuter)
(http://www.irishrail.ie/travel-information/accessibility-onboard-trains/planning-your-journey).
This type of accessibility policy means that many disabled people are unable to travel without
careful planning, and a lot of the time constantly changing plans mean that this planning cannot
be done.
Another thing that limits spontaneity when travelling if you’re a wheelchair user is something I
have discussed in another article, the availability of accessible taxis. Recently, I was visiting
relatives in Mayo and after a few days, I took the train home, again after contacting Irish Rail in
advance, and then got the Luas most of the way home. Finally, I went to a nearby taxi rank to

get a taxi to my house. There were no accessible taxis there and so, because there have been
times that I ordered a taxi on the app and waited up to half an hour past the pickup time for it
to arrive, I decided to try asking if one of the drivers in a normal taxi would take me, since my
chair can fold up to easily fit in the boot of a car. Luckily, he was okay with it, however this is
not the usual reaction. I have been turned away from many taxis in the past because the driver
would not take me even when I told them I could put my chair in the boot. I have even been
late to events because I was not able to get a taxi on time, despite ordering an accessible taxi
from the app and, when 20 minutes passed with no sign of the taxi, asking drivers if they could
take me if I folded my chair. They said no. While accessible taxis are of course preferable to
having to fold your wheelchair and put it in the boot, I believe it should still be an option due to
how unreliable accessible taxis can be.
Overall, travelling on most public transport when you have a disability in Ireland requires a
large amount of planning ahead, often taking days and making it impossible to travel on a
whim. I have said this before and will say it again, disabled people have lives too, and plans
often change meaning you can’t always arrange something 24 hours or even just 4 hours in
advance. While these policies are in place, when this happens disabled people are left unable to
travel, and that’s a clear sign that we as a society have a lot to do before we can truly say public
transport is accessible to all.
