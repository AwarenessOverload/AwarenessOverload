As a young adult living in Dublin, I use public transport on an almost-daily basis. Doing this, I have noticed that there is only one wheelchair seating bay on Dublin Bus buses, and this has made me think: is this enough? According to a poll taken by members of the Disabled People of Ireland group on Facebook, it is not.


As of the time of writing this article, 7 people have voiced that this is not enough in the poll, compared to none saying that it is, with comments outlining that many disabled people find themselves needing to travel with friends or family members that are also disabled, but they are unable to sinceonly one space is provided. The size of the space has also been mentioned here as inadequate for some wheelchairs, but that’s a discussion for another day.


It is important to remember that disabled people often live busy lives too, and when you consider that a single space on a bus being occupied can lead to major delays for that person, it’s clear that there is discrimination happening here. Additionally, as Dublin Bus worker director Stephen Hannan has outlined to the Oireachtas, in most cases when the accessible space is occupied it is people with buggies that occupy the wheelchair bay and refuse to fold them up so that the wheelchair user can board. This is usually met with a shrug by the driver and the bus pulling away, leaving the disabled person behind. As a user who has chosen to remain anonymous on Facebook points out, “It also causes animosity and embarrassment for both the disabled person and non disabled person which could altogether be avoided if the driver just enforced that [..] the non disabled person has to vacate the space”.


While I do not believe people with buggies should be banned outright from using these wheelchair bays, stricter legislation needs to be put in place. Even if this does not happen, another space would at least increase the disabled person’s chances of getting a seat. Finally, while it is true that, according to the Dublin Bus website, buses in Dublin made after 2010 are legally required to have both a wheelchair bay and a buggy space, these are still very few and far between, with under half of the Dublin Bus fleet having these. As such, they are only used in major routes, with less important routes such as the 54a being ignored and left with older buses.


It can sometimes be hard to be active when you’re disabled, and a public transport system that makes you rely on a single space being free can make it near-impossible, which is why it needs to change.
