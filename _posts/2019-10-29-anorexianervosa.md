Anorexia came into my life shortly after I entered highschool. That’s where it would stay at
varying levels until present day. Officially I’ve been diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa for
over thirteen years, unofficially it’s closer to fifteen. I never quite know where it began or in
what order. It’s a chicken and egg scenario. What came first, the depression, anxiety or
eating disorder?
That’s the thing about eating disorders; They never exist alone. Chances are depression and
anxiety will co-exist due to an imbalance of hormones, depletion of the body&#39;s nutritional
needs and the ill effects of malnutrition. Or, like me, you may be stuck on deciding if they
were already there in the first place, subsequently feeding into the development of the eating
disorder.
Either way it doesn’t change the tremendous struggle that it is to live daily alongside an
eating disorder.
For a long time I was unable to separate myself and the Anorexia Nervosa. It was mine, it
was a ‘She’ and together we were perfectly happy. After being in quasi-recovery for over
four years, a place where the anorexia and me were very much estranged friends, I decided
to call her up in late 2018. I called because I needed to feel anything other than perpetual
fear, crippling self-doubt and ‘FAT’. At the time I was working in a very stressful work
environment that, in hindsight, wasn’t healthy for my personality type. I was pushing myself
to the absolute limit and still falling short. I knew anorexia, I’d danced with the devil before;
And I was damned good at it. Before weighing up the potential dangers (for which there are
many), I was out buying a scale and determined to succeed! I’d be the thinnest I had ever
been or I’d die trying.

Life with Anorexia;

Anorexia Nervosa has taken a lot from me, not only as an adult but also as a child. I’ve lost
the better part of my teenage years, relationships with friends and family, missed out on
social events, lost all confidence and, most importantly, I&#39;ve lost myself. The trauma caused
by Anorexia Nervosa has left me so damaged that in December ‘18 I suffered from a
breakdown. In hindsight it’s not surprising considering the pressure I was under, and had put
myself under for years. Consequently this meant that I could no longer carry on with my job,
and so was signed off on sick leave. I’ve since left the position altogether.
In order to cover all the areas in which my life is impacted, and to put it simply, I’m going to
try and keep this relatively short. Anorexia and the impacts of such can become so complex
that it can be difficult for non-sufferers to understand. In fact, my specialised therapist has

recently had to advocate for me to disability services because there was so little
understanding surrounding the issues we suffer.
For example;
My memory has been severely impacted.
Although completely unable to focus and retain basic information while actively starving
myself, there’s little to no improvement when I’m eating ‘normally’. When I was working I
could barely remember driving into work in the morning and now, eight months later, I find
myself relying on one-too-many alarms just to remind me to eat or take medication. I’ve a
tendency to watch the same episode of a show over and over again, and still view it as
brand new. If it’s not in the diary or plastered on my phone&#39;s calendar with a pre-set alarm;
Then it’s not happening. My short term memory is by far the worst. Sometimes I find myself
having the same conversation with my partner over and over, until he’s exhausted trying to
explain that we’ve talked about it not five minutes before. It never ceases to amaze people
just how quickly I can forget something.
The depression and anxiety can be crippling.
I’ve suffered from low moods and anxiety for years now, possibly before the eating disorder
as previously mentioned. But the depression and anxiety that co-exist with anorexia nervosa
leave you in a horrible, horrible place. The anxiety keeps me up at night, while the
depression begs me to sleep. I’m exhausted all the time because my body isn’t getting a full,
peaceful sleep and the anorexic routine keeps me fixated on a waking time of six in the
morning.
Then there are the dark, dark moods that you can find yourself in. Sometimes there is a tell-
tale build up to these bleak periods and other times it just hits you like a train. I’ve been
completely floored by depression before meaning that it’s difficult for me to find the
motivation to even get out of bed, never mind feed myself. It’s getting easier with the help of
weight restoration, therapy and medication, but it’s certainly still present.
The anxiety in particular comes in many different forms. First there is the persistent fear of
food, especially what is known as ‘fear food.’ Personally my anxiety is severely triggered by
things like milk, bread, chocolate or foods which are normally perceived as ‘bad.’ Anything
involving these, especially when I have to eat them, can send me into panic mode and
possibly a panic attack.
Secondly I mentally and physically find it difficult to leave the house without my partner or
someone I know. Throw food shopping into the mix and the anxiety increases tenfold. I
simply can’t do it. Even when I do go shopping with my partner I let him choose the food
items while I browse the non-edatables, least I spend a great portion of time reading
nutritional labels.
Thirdly there is the sheer fear that surrounds cooking. I haven’t cooked in months, possibly
years, as a result. The idea of separating, weighing, chopping, simmering etc just terrifies

me and I have no idea why. I used to cook all the time when I did my GCSE’s. Although
also suffering from anorexia at the time, I took great pride in my altering meals to suit and
then cooking them. I also took pleasure in watching others eat them while I took to washing
up.
Finally there are the physical impacts;
I suffer frequently from heart palpitations due to low potassium and an irregular heartbeat
caused by many years of self-induced vomiting and starvation. These come and go, and can
often be coupled with the anxiety.
After a long period of my feet, or even just after a simple, routine walk, I suffer from severe
muscle cramps and joint pain. In fact, in recent weeks I took a trip with my friend to Ikea and
was kept awake all night by cramps traveling from the soles of my feet right up to my upper
thighs. I put it down to the increased level of activity which I’m both not used to and not
particularly allowed to do according to my treatment plan.
It’s not unusual to suffer from joint pain as the cold weather approaches. My fingers tend to
swell up and my feet turn gray due to how cold they can become. I also suffer from lower
back pain and shoulder pain almost constantly.

The impacts of anorexia nervosa can vary from person to person, and symptoms change
daily. Some days are fine, while others can be unbearable. Truthfully unless you’ve suffered
from an eating disorder, it&#39;s hard to understand it. Quite often people see food as being the
main issue when in fact there is deep, underlying trauma which needs fully hashed out and
treated in order to reach a place of recovery. I personally attend treatment one to two times a
week on varying days. This can change depending on my level of commitment and what I’m
able to handle as therapy can be grueling. Even after nine months of treatment, I am still
nowhere near ‘recovered’ and in fact it may take many years to reach a place of normality.
The sad fact is that the majority of those with anorexia nervosa never recover, and more
people die from eating disorders every year than any other mental illness. Yet the public
understanding is that anorexia recovery is simply a case of refeeding and then you’ll be
cured. I’ve heard the words ‘just eat something’ uttered to me on one too many occasions
and it’s simply infuriating.
Public awareness and understanding of all eating disorders, not just anorexia nervosa,
needs to be improved. The services for treatment are also in dire need of improvement,
however with limited NHS funding and a lack of Northern Irish government, this is unlikely to
happen in the near future.
