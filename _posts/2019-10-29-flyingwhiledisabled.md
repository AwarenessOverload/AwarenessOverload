In the modern age, air travel is a regular thing for many people. Whether it’s for a holiday or
for a business trip, the average person flies abroad 1 to 2 times a year, and if you’re abled
the process of doing so is easy. Just book your flight, go to the airport, go through security,
get on your flight and you’re off, care-free. If you’re disabled, on the other hand, it’s a
different story, and this is what I will discuss in this article.
Firstly, the assistance offered at airports for disabled people is usually very poor. Usually
handled by a company such as OCS, those needing assistance are required to go and let
them know assistance is needed. They are then usually told to wait for someone to arrive
and help them. Luckily, most times that this has happened I have not personally been
waiting for too long, but earlier this year when I was flying out of Berlin I went to the
assistance desk and was told to wait as usual, and an hour passed with no sign of anyone
from the assistance team. Luckily I had arrived at the airport unnecessarily early, or else I
would have missed my flight. The reason for delays like this is often that the assistance
companies are severely understaffed. In her article ‘Airports are failing disabled passengers,
and we are tired of it’ (https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/14/airports-
failing-disabled-travellers-wheelchair-assistance-paralympic), speaker and Paralympic medallist
Elizabeth Wright describes how she was left waiting to get off a flight for over an hour, and
when assistance did finally arrive there were not enough employees for the four wheelchair
users onboard. Despite the important role they play, these companies tend to have a
dangerously low amount of employees, which negatively affects the experiences of every
disabled person going through the airport.

Next, boarding a flight can also be considerably more stressful for disabled people,
particularly non-ambulatory wheelchair users. The standard procedure is for the wheelchair
user to transfer or be lifted into an aisle chair, which is then brought to their seat, which
they transfer to or are moved onto. This seems simple and not stressful at all, right?
Problems arise, however, depending on when the wheelchair user boards. If they board
first, it’s quick and easy. If they board last, however, squeezing past everyone, sometimes
even getting a rogue hand or elbow in the face, it can be a nightmare. Unfortunately, you
have no say in the matter either. Different airlines do it differently, such as Ryanair always
getting wheelchair users onboard last. Of course, all of this only if you successfully get
assistance while boarding, unlike Trinity student Niamh Herbert who was denied boarding
on a flight to London because she could not walk up the steps despite having requested
wheelchair assistance in her booking, a fact which Ryanair later denied.

So after all this you think it would be the end of the problems, right? Wrong. After landing,
wheelchair users have to wait for their chair to be brought to the plane, and this can take a
*very* long time. To give you an idea of this if you haven’t been in this situation, the
shortest amount of time I’ve had to wait is half an hour. That’s half an hour after all of the

able-bodied passengers have disembarked, waiting. Although that being said, after that wait
if you get your wheelchair back in one piece by the end of it you’re statistically lucky.
According to recent statistics, airlines in America damage or lose an average of 26
wheelchairs a day, amounting to 1,975 wheelchairs in a three-month period
(http://www.newmobility.com/2019/04/airlines-damaged-wheelchairs/). There have been no
statistics released for airlines in Ireland or England, but regardless that is a shocking amount
of wheelchairs, especially when you consider how much of an inconvenience losing a
wheelchair can be. In a thread
(https://twitter.com/twitchyspoonie/status/1112052383767392256), Twitter user
TheDisabilityEnthusiast (@twitchyspoonie) describes how, when travelling with Southwest
Airlines, her wheelchair was damaged. The airline promised to pay for it to be fixed, but
after saying this it was over a month before she heard from them again. In this time, she
was unable to leave her house and could not work, choosing at one point to try and go to
work without her wheelchair. The pain caused by doing this took weeks to recover from. As I
have said many, many times before, most disabled people have busy lives like the rest of the
population, but when airline staff see a wheelchair as nothing more than luggage and break
it, those lives are disrupted and the consequences of being unable to leave the house
because of this can be dire.
Overall, disabled people face a plethora of challenges when it comes to air travel that make
many, wheelchair users especially, dread going on an airplane, and this is why the Twitter
hashtag #FlyingWhileDisabled was created. This hashtag has been used by many people
such as author Stephanie Tait and activist Alice Wong to share their own disability travel
horror stories, and I would recommend reading through it for more on this issue.

“Many wheelchair users […] dream of the day when we could just drive onto an aircraft with
our wheelchair just as if it were driving onto a bus or a train.”
