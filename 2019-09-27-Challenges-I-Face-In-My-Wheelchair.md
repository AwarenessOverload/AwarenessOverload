I am a 47 year old guy who previously worked in medical teams at sports events, pop
concerts, festivals etc, in 2010 As I fell on the ice, the crack of my bones breaking as my foot turned 90° inwards sounded really loud in the cold air; life was about to get very complicated. Nine years later I am reliant on a wheelchair and soon will be having a below knee amputation.
<br/>
<br/>
One of the first things I found was just how tiring it is using a wheelchair and my
wheelchair is a lightweight made of aluminium! Pedestrian zones that look smooth and
flat, often have a tiny incline making it even harder.
<br/>
<br/>
Many people make an effort to be helpful which is really good. However if you see
someone in a wheelchair struggling first please ask how you can help. Some wheelchair
users may want to be as independent as possible, personally I am always grateful.
<br/>
<br/>
Something I know a lot of wheelchair users dislike is when someone walks behind them
and just starts pushing their wheelchair. It is scary and the instinct is to quickly apply the
brakes! Often I'll take a quick push up a slope or incline as long as someone asks first.
<br/>
<br/>
One of the biggest things that would make a difference to wheelchair users getting about
is if people stopped parking on the pavement or in front of dropped kerbs. As a wheelchair
user I desperately need those dropped kerbs to safely cross the road and need space to
safely navigate the paths. More than once i've ended up in a patch of nettles trying to get
past a car parking on pavement. If new laws are passed drivers could be fined up to £130
if caught parking on pavements (it is already illegal in London).
<br/>
<br/>
It would also help if people who don't need disabled parking due to a disability or health
condition would stop using disabled parking bays. Only using it for five minutes, no one
else is using it, there are loads of bays; are not good enough reasons. I have had many
close shaves in car parks in my wheelchair when a car, especially a big car eg: BMW X5 or
Range Rover hasn't seen my wheelchair as Its below their line of sight. Should I risk an
accident as someone is only using a bay for five minutes? Car parks often have slopes,
which I mentioned earlier are a nightmare.
<br/>
<br/>
This is a tiny little insight into the daily challenges I face while I am in my wheelchair. There
are many others but they are for another post on another day.
