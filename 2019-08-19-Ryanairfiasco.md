On the 9th of August this summer 17 year old Sean McCullough was due to fly home from Manchester with his family when the OCS transport to the Ryanair plane was slightly delayed. Much to the families surprise and confusion Ryanair refused to let the family board the plane due to the fact that Sean is a wheelchair user and it would take to long to assist him to his seat and store the wheelchair with the luggage. When Sean and his parents protested this issue not only did Ryanair not offer a refund for the tickets they also threatened to ban Sean and his family from future Ryanair flights. The reason being was members of staff were "verbally abused". But no insults were made and no voices were raised.  This argument caused an even bigger delay than there would've been if Sean and his family were just allowed to board in the first place. If not for the persistence of Sean's parents and the decency and professionalism of the pilot, Sean and his family would've missed their flight and would have to book and pay for a whole new one.


This is an excellent example of the lack of care and general effort provided by not just Manchester special services and Ryanair. Once again we see how the minorities suffer at the expense of the majority of society. The disabled community is still viewed as a minority in this day and age.

 

Sandra Mccullagh Seans mother took to facebook to vent and share their upset about the incident. Sean was returning from volunteering for the Back up Charity – teaching wheelchair skills to people with Spinal injuries in Manchester. Sean is a wheelchair athlete who has represented Ireland on numerous occasions.
