For the last few days, I have been on holiday in Dalyan, Turkey. It’s been great, relaxing all
day in the 30-to-40 degree heat, however getting here wasn’t so easy. I forgot to get Visas
(get them from the official e-visa website to avoid being ripped off, also make sure your
passport is at least 6 months in date!) and was not let on the planned flight, so we had to
get a flight from Belfast airport four days later. There was a lot involved in this journey, and
so I decided to note the accessibility at each step of the way.
First of all, before the journey even started I encountered a problem. Bus Éireann advertise
that you have to let them know if a wheelchair user is travelling with them 24 hours in
advance, since there is only one space per bus. Eager to make sure I got on that bus, I rang
them 48 hours in advance. Despite this, I was not able to be guaranteed a space, and I hung
up only half-sure that I would be on that bus at all, and frustrated. Why must basic
accessibility be something that wheelchair users have to go out of their way this much to
get, and even then doubt that they’ll get it? Also, one space per bus, as I have covered in
relation to Dublin Bus, is not enough, especially for buses that travel long distances with
multiple stops.
On the day, I got a Luas to Busáras. I’ve been on the Luas many times, and aside from it
being extremely crowded, this time it went pretty well. At Busáras, I went to the toilet
before the journey, since it was 2 and a half hours to get to Belfast. The accessible toilet in
Busáras is quite good, well-kept with enough space to get in and move around. To get on
the bus, I used a lift on the side, which was quite secure. It took a bit more time to get on
the bus because of this, and so I would recommend being there early. Once onboard my
chair was secured into place and we were off.
With the exception of some questionable driving not helped by the fact that the belts
securing my wheelchair to the ground needed tightening, the journey from Dublin to Belfast
went without a hitch. When I got to Belfast, there was another bus I had to take to the
airport. This bus has a ramp that has to be manually put down by the driver. As such, it is
possible that a driver could just consider it too much hassle and not put it down, but this
didn’t happen for me. It also goes without saying that free travel passes from the Republic
of Ireland can’t be used in the North.
At Belfast International Airport, accessibility is quite good. There are some accessible toilets
throughout the building, and they are quite spacious and well-equipped however it’s
important to note that there is quite a distance between them, with one near the entrance
and a few at the boarding gates. The airport itself is a quite accessible building, but it does
get slightly narrow but manageable after security in the duty-free shopping area. If you are a
wheelchair user, it’s recommended that you get to your boarding gate half an hour to an
hour before your flight, and the staff are very helpful, providing assistance through the
airport and an aisle chair for getting on the plane if needed.

I got on the flight and just over 4 hours later, arrived in Dalaman Airport. If you are a
wheelchair user, you’re most likely very used to waiting long times for the airport staff to
get your chair and I’m glad to say I was waiting a significantly shorter amount of time at
Dalaman, about 6 minutes, and Dalaman Airport itself is quite accessible. It is, however, a
very large building with a lot of ground to cover, but if you get tired at any time the airport
staff are more than happy to help. At the exit, there is a gently-sloping ramp that brings you
down to the ground. We had booked one of the Crescent Twins villas in Dalyan, so there
was a taxi waiting to collect us. While the vehicle we were in was quite big, the way my
wheelchair was secured was not very promising, one belt tied to the back of the chair. This
may not be the case for other taxis in Turkey, but it made for a bumpy ride.
Now that I described how it was getting to Dalyan, I will use the rest of this article as a
review of the Crescent Twins villas. These villas are advertised as being great for accessibility
and they definitely are. The entrances are a wide gate with a ramp, requiring a good bit of
force to push up in a wheelchair but far from a problem. Inside the villa, there are three
bedrooms and three bathrooms, one on each floor, with a lift going between floors. Each
bedroom has enough space to quite comfortably fit a wheelchair, there is no hoist to get
into the beds normally, but if this needed you can ask for it and the Crescent Hotel staff will
be able to help. Most of the bathrooms in the villas are equipped with a shower and shower
chair that both just fit over the toilet , however it should be noted that there are two chair
types in the villas, one with a removable seat and one with a fixed seat. I would recommend
the fixed seat, as the removable seat can slide and cause injury if you move around too
much.
Outside of the bedrooms and bathrooms, the rest of the villa is very accessible. There are
two entrances, a normal door leading into a relatively wide hallway and a sliding glass door
(with a mosquito net, which is needed!) leading into the spacious main kitchen/sitting room
area of the villa. There is a small metal ramp at the bottom of this entrance, and while it’s
better than having to push over the bottom of the door, it has to be approached at the right
angle, which can be hard since there is a table right in front of it. Finally, the pool and the
area around it are very accessible, with ramps leading down from the villa, over to the
Jacuzzi and down to a small grassy area. At the pool, there is a water-powered chair lift that
can lower you into the pool if needed, and there are pool noodles provided in case you need
them for flotation. If there was one thing that isn&#39;t perfect for accessibility about the pool
setup, it&#39;s that the chair lift is at the deep end, however this did not impact on my overall
opinion of the villa as highly accessible.
Overall, my journey from Dublin to Dalyan went quite well and while there was one or two
blips it was mostly accessible. I am also pleasantly surprised by the accessibility of the
Crescent Twins villas in Dalyan and would definitely recommend them to any wheelchair
users travelling to the area.
