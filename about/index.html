Benat, age 15, is from Dublin, Ireland and is currently a Patient Ambassador for the charity Cystic Fibrosis Ireland.


Benat lives with cystic fibrosis and he says cystic fibrosis affects him in many different ways. He says, “It affects my breathing. It affects me gaining weight. It also affects my day-to-day life. I need to do nebulisers every day, chest physio and other things to prevent me getting chest infections.”


While most other young people would point to a particular holiday, or special event, or sporting achievement, for Benat the highlight of his life to date is getting access to the ground-breaking cystic fibrosis drug Orkambi two years ago. Benat says it has made a big difference to his life. His lung function has increased, he has more energy to live life to the full and he is in hospital less.


Benat wants to raise awareness of cystic fibrosis. He says, “sometimes when people hear me coughing, they think it’s contagious and that they are going to catch it”. It seems they either assume he has a ‘flu or a cold, or don’t think about other causes of coughing, such as cystic fibrosis.


Benat is in his fourth year (transition year) in secondary school. He has ambitions to one day work in broadcasting and to have a career in journalism. He also longs to explore the length and breadth of the United States of America and Australia.

Benat has also won "Volunteer Of The Year" winning the Junior Section of the Pramerica Spirit Of Community Awards. 

Benat has written articles for the top Irish Newspapers, such as the Irish Times & The Irish Indepedent. He has spoken on radio to Ireland’s top names such as Ryan Tubridy, Sean Ó Rourke, Ciara Kelly and many others. 

Benat has also hosted fundraising events, public speaking and has aired on both national & international TV including BBC Breakfast, RTÉ News2day and many more.
