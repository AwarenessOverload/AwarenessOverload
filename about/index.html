"I started Awareness Overload in transition year, February 2019 as nothing more than a class project. 
Since May 2019 it has become a team of 7 activists writing about issues regarding policies and legislation affecting 
     the disabled community in Ireland. We are a fun mix of amateur and professional writers and activists." </li>

“Sport And wheelchair skills have always been a huge passion of mine. I have been on the Irish Para Athletics Squad from 2011 starting as a seated javelin shot putt and discus thrower and now an Irish record holding Wheelchair Racer. I currently hold the Irish national records for the 100m,200m,400m & 800m. Coaching has always been something I’ve wanted to do and I’m currently going into my final year of Sports Strength and Conditioning Coaching in LIT thurles. I’m currently coaching a wheelchair basketball club in nenagh co. Tipperary, my colleague Oisin in track racing and also an Egyptian and Malaysian Wheelchair Racer by online coaching.
